## Executive Summary

This document analyzes ability mechanics from 7 popular PvP/competitive games to identify what makes abilities feel impactful and fun. Key findings include:

- **Cooldown Scaling** is universal (fixed base → scaling with stats)
- **Resource Systems** vary by game (mana, energy, ultimates, charges)
- **Ability Tiers** (Normal/Tactical/Ultimate) create clear power progression
- **Effect Stacking** requires careful management (diminishing returns)
- **Ultimate Design** separates 3 categories: resource-gated, cooldown-based, charge-based
- **Combo Potential** emerges from ability resets and conditional triggers

## Game-by-Game Analysis

### 1. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
*MOBA, Turn-based ability system, Scaling focus*

#### Ability Structure
- **Passive:** Always active, defines role identity
- **Q, W, E:** Primary rotation abilities (3 normal abilities)
- **R:** Ultimate ability (most powerful)
- **Total:** 4-5 abilities per champion

#### Cooldown System
- **Base Design:** Fixed cooldown per ability (varies 6-120s)
- **Scaling Mechanic:** Ability Haste (abbreviated CDR - Cooldown Reduction)
  - Direct stat: Lower cooldown by percentage
  - Cap: Typically 40% (reduced by 60% of base cooldown)
  - Item-based: Different items provide varying amounts
  - Stat-based: Build paths determine CDR amount
- **Mechanics:** Cooldowns start AFTER ability fires

#### Resource Systems (Champions can have 2 max)
- **Mana:** Primary resource for most champions
  - Large pool (300-500 base)
  - Slow regeneration (5-15 per 5 sec)
  - Costs vary by ability (40-150 mana)
  - Strategic: Manage mana to limit rotation

- **Alternative Resources:**
  - Energy (Akali, Lee Sin): Small pool (0-200), fast regen
  - Fury (Garen, Tryndamere): Generated by actions
  - Flow (Ahri): Generated by movement
  - Heat (Brand): Builds on ability usage
  - Essence (Pyke): Special passive generator

#### Damage Types
- Physical Damage: Scaled by Attack Damage (AD)
- Ability Power (AP): Magical damage scaling
- True Damage: Bypasses armor/magic resist
- Hybrid: Mix of physical + AP (rare)
- Percentage Health: True damage scaling (e.g., Abilities damage % max HP)

#### Ability Scaling Examples
- Q: 60% AD + 40% AP = Hybrid scaling
- W: 150 base + (8% AP) per 100 AP
- E: 70% armor reduction + base damage
- Scaling coefficients vary 0.2x to 1.5x per stat

#### Special Mechanics
- **Ability Resets:** Kill resets all cooldowns (Kat, Akshan)
- **Charges:** Multiple uses per cooldown (Yasuo Q)
- **Conditional Triggers:** Passive procs from basic attacks

- **Resource Cost:** High mana (100-200)
- **Game-Changing:** Teamfight winning, not just "stronger Q"
- **Variety:** Some are toggles, some are point-and-click, some are skillshots

#### Cooldown Reduction (CDR) System Details
- **Early Game:** Minimal CDR (0-10%)
- **Mid Game:** Items grant 20-40% CDR
- **Late Game:** Maximize CDR through itemization
- **Cap System:** Hard cap prevents unlimited spam
- **Strategic Depth:** CDR becomes major build decision

#### Combo Potential
- **Ability Chaining:** Abilities that synergize with specific build paths
- **Animation Canceling:** Reducing ability cast time through mechanics

## NEXUS-Specific Recommendations

### Ability Structure (Recommended for NEXUS)

```javascript
// Per Hero Base Structure
{
  passive: {
    name: "Trait",
    effect: "Always active",
    cooldown: 0,
    scalingType: "passive"
  },
  abilities: {
    Q: {
      name: "Primary Ability",
      cooldown: "6-12 seconds (role-based)",
      manaCost: "40-80",
      scalingType: "physical|magical",
      effects: ["damage", "positioning", "utility"],
      range: "400-800px"
    },
    E: {
      name: "Secondary Ability",
      cooldown: "9-15 seconds",
      manaCost: "60-100",
      scalingType: "physical|magical",
      effects: ["CC", "utility", "defense"],
      range: "300-600px"
    },
    R: {
      name: "Ultimate",
      cooldown: "75-100 seconds",
      manaCost: "100-150",
      scalingType: "physical|magical",
      effects: ["game-changing", "teamfight", "unique"],
      range: "500-1000px"
    }
  }
}
```

### Resource System Recommendation
**Hybrid Cooldown + Mana Model:**
- **Primary Gate:** Cooldowns (prevent spam)
- **Secondary Gate:** Mana (prevent total lockout)
- **Scaling:** Cooldown Reduction through items/stats
- **Progression:** Early game = weak rotation, late game = strong rotation

### Cooldown Reduction Implementation
```javascript
{
  baseCooldown: 12,
  cooldownReductionStat: 0.25, // 25% CDR from items
  effectiveCooldown: 12 * (1 - 0.25) = 9 seconds
  // Cap at 40% CDR to prevent unlimited spam
}
```

### Effect Types (Prioritize Implementation Order)
1. **Damage** (primary ability purpose)
2. **Stun** (hard CC, 1 sec duration)
3. **Slow** (soft CC, 40% slow)
4. **Knockback** (positioning tool)
5. **Heal** (support only)
6. **Shield** (damage mitigation)
7. **Buff** (temporary stat increase)
8. **Debuff** (temporary stat decrease)

### Ultimate Design Principles for NEXUS
- **Power Level:** 3-4x damage of Q ability
- **Cooldown:** Long enough to matter (75-100s)
- **Unique Mechanic:** Each role has different ultimate type
  - **Warrior:** Area damage + CC
  - **Ranger:** Precision damage + repositioning
  - **Mage:** Area damage + persistent effect
  - **Guardian:** Defensive utility + team protection
  - **Rogue:** Single target + mobility
- **Teamfight Impact:** Turns the fight (not just bonus damage)

### Combo Potential for NEXUS
**Chain Types (Implement):**
1. **Direct Chain:** Q → E → R (natural rotation)
2. **Reset Chain:** Kill → Cooldown reset on one ability
3. **Synergy Chain:** Q applies debuff → E deals more to debuffed target
4. **Passive Chain:** Passive triggers on ability usage → enhances next ability

### Cooldown Reduction Cap Strategy
- **LoL Model:** 40% cap on CDR items (good balance)
- **SMITE Model:** 50% cap with special items (allows specialization)
- **Recommendation:** 35-40% for NEXUS (prevents unlimited spam, enables itemization)

## Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Core Systems (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] Fixed cooldowns per ability (Q: 10s, E: 12s, R: 90s)
- [ ] Mana resource system (400 base, 10/5sec regen)
- [ ] Ability effects (damage, CC, positioning)
- [ ] Damage scaling (AD/AP based on hero stats)

### Phase 2: Polish & Depth (HIGH)
- [ ] Cooldown Reduction stat (20% cap initially)
- [ ] Combo mechanics (synergies between abilities)
- [ ] Effect visualization (particle effects, animations)
- [ ] Cooldown UI (clear countdown display)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Ability resets (on kill mechanics)
- [ ] Charge-based abilities (multiple charges per CD)
- [ ] Scaling cooldowns (scale with hero level)
- [ ] Economy system (items grant CDR)

### Phase 4: Balance & Tweaks (ONGOING)
- [ ] Hero ability balance (per-hero cooldown tuning)
- [ ] Effect duration balancing (CC durations)
- [ ] Damage scaling coefficients (power curves)
- [ ] Meta shifts (seasonal adjustments)

## Key Takeaways for NEXUS Design

### DO:
✓ Use multiple cooldowns (Q < E < R progression)
✓ Implement mana or energy resource (secondary gate)
✓ Create clear ability purposes (Q=damage, E=utility, R=ultimate)
✓ Design unique passives (define hero identity)
✓ Balance cooldown reduction (prevent unlimited spam)
✓ Implement crowd control types (stun, slow, knockback)
✓ Create combo potential (synergies between abilities)
✓ Scale abilities with hero stats (damage/ability power)

### DON'T:
✗ Make all abilities same cooldown (boring rotation)
✗ Infinite cooldown reduction (breaks balance)
✗ Instant ultimate charge (removes strategy)
✗ No resource management (encourages spam)
✗ Abilities with no clear purpose (confusing)
✗ Cooldowns without visual feedback (bad UX)
