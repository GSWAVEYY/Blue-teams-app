## 6. NEXUS-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Weapon System for Fantasy PvP MOBA

**NEXUS is NOT a traditional FPS.** It's a top-down MOBA with hero abilities as primary damage source. Weapons should:
- Complement, not overshadow, abilities
- Provide utility and flavor to hero roles
- Create playstyle differentiation within same role
- Reward positioning and tactical awareness

---

### RECOMMENDED WEAPON ARCHITECTURE

#### 1. **Weapon Categories by Role** (Not FPS-style)

**Warriors** (Tank Role):
- Primary Weapons: Greatswords, Battle Axes
- Secondary Weapons: Shields, Hammers
- Playstyle: High armor damage dealer, engagement opener

**Rangers** (Precision Role):
- Primary Weapons: Bows, Crossbows
- Secondary Weapons: Throwing knives, Javelins
- Playstyle: Sustained damage from range, precision rewarded

**Mages** (Spellcasting Role):
- Primary Weapons: Staffs, Wands
- Secondary Weapons: Orbs, Grimoires
- Playstyle: Ability-focused with weapon-based spell scaling

**Guardians** (Support Role):
- Primary Weapons: Maces, War Hammers
- Secondary Weapons: Tomes, Shields
- Playstyle: Defensive utility with team buffs

**Rogues** (Assassin Role):
- Primary Weapons: Daggers, Short Blades
- Secondary Weapons: Claws, Poison daggers
- Playstyle: High burst damage, close-range execution

---

#### 2. **Damage Model for NEXUS (MOBA Context)**

```javascript
// Weapon damage calculation (pseudo-code for reference)
baseDamage = weaponBase + (heroAD * scalingRatio);
finalDamage = baseDamage * (1 - (enemyArmor / 100));
critDamage = (baseDamage * 1.5) - enemyArmor; // Crit multiplier
```

**Scaling System:**
- **AD (Attack Damage)**: Primary stat for physical weapons
- **AP (Ability Power)**: Scaling for magic weapons
- **Health Scaling**: Some weapons scale with max HP
- **Armor Scaling**: Utility weapons benefit from defensive stats

**Crit Chance & Multiplier:**
- Base crit chance: 0% (crit from items only)
- Crit multiplier: 1.5x by default (150% damage)
- Weapon-specific crit bonuses (Rangers +10%, Warriors -5%)

---

#### 3. **Weapon Attack Types** (NOT Hitscan/Projectile)

**Melee Attacks** (Instant, close range)
- Greatswords, Axes, Daggers
- Range: 60-100 pixels
- Animation frame: 0.3s swing
- Cooldown: Inherent attack speed stat
- Applies on-hit effects (stun, slow)

**Ranged Attacks** (Projectile, medium range)
- Bows, Crossbows, Javelins
- Range: 300-500 pixels
- Travel time: 0.3-0.5s
- Applies on-hit effects
- Can miss (requires leading moving targets)

**Spell Attacks** (AoE, utility)
- Staff blasts, Wand bolts
- Range: 250-400 pixels
- Scaling: Ability Power (AP) instead of AD
- Creates damage zones
- Applies status effects

---

#### 4. **Resource System** (No Ammo, Use Cooldown Instead)

**Attack Speed System:**
```
Base Attack Speed: 1.0 (attacks per second)
Attack Cooldown: 1 / attackSpeed seconds
Scaling: +10% AS per point of Agility stat
```

**Why No Ammo:**
- MOBA games don't use ammo (breaks momentum)
- Instead: Attack cooldown creates resource management
- Focus on ability cooldowns for resource depth
- Weapon swap might regenerate teammate cooldowns (support mechanic)

**Alternative (Optional Resource):**
- "Weapon Energy": Regenerates over time (like mana)
- Heavy attacks consume more energy
- Incentivizes precision over spam
- Supports (regenerate team energy near them)

---

#### 5. **Damage Type Variety** (Fantasy Elements)

**Physical Damage Types:**
- **Slashing** (Swords, Axes): Bleeds opponents (DoT)
- **Piercing** (Spears, Arrows): Armor penetration (ignore 20% armor)
- **Crushing** (Hammers, Maces): Stun on hit (chance to stun)

**Magical Damage Types:**
- **Arcane**: Pure damage (ignores 50% armor)
- **Fire**: Applies burn (DoT, reduced healing)
- **Frost**: Applies slow (movement speed -30%)
- **Poison**: DoT + reduced armor (stacking debuff)
- **Lightning**: Chain effect (bounces to nearby enemies)

**Effect Application:**
- Warriors deal Slashing + Crushing
- Rangers deal Piercing + Physical
- Mages deal Arcane + Elemental (Fire/Frost/Poison)
- Guardians deal Crushing + Arcane
- Rogues deal Piercing + Poison

---

#### 6. **Special Weapon Mechanics**

**Charging Weapons** (High risk/reward)
```
Greatsword Charge: Hold to charge
- 0.5s: 100% damage (0% charge)
- 1.0s: 150% damage (50% charge)
- 1.5s: 200% damage (100% charge) + knockback
- Break charging to instantly release
```

**Weapon Switching** (Tactical layer)
- Switch time: 0.5s (visible animation)
- Hero loses movement for duration
- Switching teammate weapon resets its cooldown (team coordination)
- Only switch between primary + secondary (no third weapon)

**Multi-Strike Weapons** (Rogues, Rangers)
```
Dagger Strike: 3-hit combo
- Hit 1: 60% damage
- Hit 2: 80% damage
- Hit 3: 100% damage + knockback
- Each hit resets if misses
- Rewards consecutive hits (skill expression)
```

**Spread/Cone Weapons** (Shotguns analog)
```
Battle Axe: Cone attack 90 degrees
- Damage: 120% base (single target: 100%)
- Radius: 150 pixels
- Hits all enemies in cone
- Reduced accuracy, high damage
```

---

#### 7. **Economy Integration** (Optional Scaling)

**No Gold System (Unlike traditional MOBAs):**
- All heroes start with same weapons
- Weapons scale with stats (no purchasing)
- Focus: Stat growth + ability cooldown reduction

**Alternative: Level-Based Scaling**
```
Level 1-5: Base weapons (weak)
Level 6-12: Weapon enhancements unlock
Level 13-18: Ultimate weapon forms (strong)
```

**Attachment System (Optional):**
```
Bow: Arrow Type Selection
- Standard Arrow: 100% damage
- Piercing Arrow: +20% armor pen
- Explosive Arrow: AoE damage (reduced single target)
- Poison Arrow: Applies DoT (reduced damage)

Hero chooses attachment style for match
```

---

#### 8. **Synergies with Abilities**

**Weapon-Ability Combos:**
- Q Ability triggers weapon effect (enhanced damage)
- E Ability applies weapon element bonus (scaling)
- R Ultimate: Weapon transforms for high damage
- Passive: Weapon attack speed increased by passive effect

**Team Synergies:**
- Warrior's weapon grants nearby allies armor buff
- Ranger's weapon grants nearby allies vision
- Mage's weapon grants nearby allies AP buff
- Guardian's weapon shields allies on attack
- Rogue's weapon applies vulnerability (enemies take +10% damage)

**Counter-Play:**
- Weapon choice reveals hero playstyle
- Enemy team adapts to damage types
- Weapon switching mid-fight creates positioning windows
- Supports exploit team weapon synergies

---

#### 9. **Weapon Balance Principles**

**Damage Curve:**
- Melee: Highest DPS (highest risk)
- Ranged: Medium DPS (medium range)
- Magic: Lowest DPS (highest utility/CC)

**Attack Speed Variance:**
- Warriors: 0.8 AS (slow, heavy hits)
- Rangers: 1.0 AS (balanced)
- Mages: 1.2 AS (fast, weak hits)
- Guardians: 0.9 AS (defensive)
- Rogues: 1.3 AS (burst style)

**Weapon Ranges:**
- Melee (Warrior/Rogue): 60-100px
- Ranged (Ranger): 350-500px
- Magic (Mage): 250-400px
- Support (Guardian): 200-300px

---

#### 10. **Visual Feedback** (Critical for MOBA Clarity)

**Weapon Effects by Category:**
```javascript
// Melee Impact
- Screen shake on heavy hits
- Particle burst on critical strike
- Blood splatter on lethal blow

// Ranged Impact
- Arrow trail particle effect
- Impact dust cloud on hit
- Ricochet effect on miss

// Magic Impact
- Spell glow aura on casting
- Element color (blue=frost, red=fire, purple=poison)
- AoE circle indicator before cast

// Status Effects
- Stun: Star animation above hero
- Slow: Icy overlay on hero
- Burn: Flame particles trailing hero
- Shield: Blue dome around hero
```

## 8. SUMMARY: NEXUS WEAPON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principles:**

1. **Complementary, Not Dominant**: Weapons enhance abilities, don't replace them
2. **Tactical Variety**: Different weapons create different playstyles
3. **Skill Expression**: Attack timing, positioning, element choice rewards mastery
4. **Team Synergy**: Weapon types support team compositions
5. **Counter-Play**: Damage types create strategic rock-paper-scissors
6. **Fantasy Theme**: Magic + physical weapons feel distinct
7. **Clear Feedback**: Visual effects make weapon impacts satisfying
8. **Balanced Scaling**: No weapon dominates all scenarios

**Avoid:**
- Random RNG (spray patterns should be learnable)
- Ammo scarcity (breaks MOBA momentum)
- Too many weapon types (7-9 per role max)
- Unclear damage calculations (communication is key)
- One dominant meta weapon (always balance alternatives)
