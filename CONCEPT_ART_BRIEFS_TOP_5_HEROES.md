## 📋 ARTIST NOTES

### General Guidelines:

1. **Silhouette**: Each character should be instantly recognizable by silhouette alone
2. **Color**: Use saturated colors; avoid muted/desaturated tones
3. **Glow**: Include subtle glow effects (not overdone)
4. **Details**: Add small details that reinforce personality (tattoos, scars, accessories)
5. **Movement**: Design should suggest movement/action even at rest
6. **Proportion**: Slightly stylized/exaggerated (not realistic)

### Style Reference:
- **Inspiration**: League of Legends (bold colors, clear silhouettes)
- **Not like**: Realistic/gritty (too dark for mobile)
- **Aesthetic**: Cyberpunk fantasy, neon accents, dynamic poses

### Animation Notes:
- Hair should move/flow
- Cloaks/robes should billow
- Glows should pulse
- Effects should be visible
