  /|   |\
   |   |  ← Moving through air (web swinging)
  / \ / \
```

   - Purple glow between eyes
   - Expression alien, non-human

2. **Chest**:
   - Form-fitting assassin bodysuit
   - Spider mandala pattern on chest
   - Purple web patterns glow
   - Eight-point design references spiders

3. **Arms**:

   - Web spinners on wrists (visible)
   - Creates web trails as attacks
   - Purple trails show web paths

4. **Legs**:
   - Can position on walls/ceilings (web attachment points)

   - Web connects to surfaces
   - Floating/climbing aesthetic

5. **Weapons**:
   - Spinning web attacks (mobility focus)
   - Can swing through arena (web ropes)
   - Creates temporary web platforms
   - Secondary weapon wraps enemies in web

6. **Overall Feel**: Arachnid predator, mobile through webs, not static traps

**DISTINCT FROM VOS**:
- Vos: Static trap mines scattered (area denial)
- Silk: Mobile web creation for movement and trapping (utility + assassin)

**Visual Personality**: Scaling walls, swinging through air, predatory animal grace
